            <strong>Early Life and Career</strong> - Bob Marley was born on 6
            February 1945 at the farm of his maternal grandfather in Nine Mile,
            Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica, to Norval Sinclair Marley and Cedella
            Malcolm.

          <h3 class="py-3 text-center">Music Career</h3>
          <li>
            <strong>1962 - 72</strong> : In February 1962, Marley
            recorded four songs, "Judge Not", "One Cup of Coffee", "Do You Still
            Love Me?" and "Terror", at Federal Studios for local music producer
            Leslie Kong
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1972 - 74:</strong> - In 1972, Bob Marley
            signed with CBS Records in London and embarked on a UK tour with
            soul singer Johnny Nash.[44] While in London the Wailers asked their
            road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who
            had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1974 - 76:</strong> - Despite the break-up,
            Marley continued recording as "Bob Marley & The Wailers". His new
            backing band included brothers Carlton and Aston "Family Man"
            Barrett on drums and bass respectively, Junior Marvin and Al
            Anderson on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl "Wya" Lindo on
            keyboards, and Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on percussion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1976 - 79:</strong> - Marley left Jamaica at
            the end of 1976, and after a month-long "recovery and writing"
            sojourn at the site of Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios in
            Nassau, Bahamas, arrived in England, where he spent two years in
            self-imposed exile.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1979-1981:</strong> Survival, a defiant and politically
            charged album, was released in 1979. Tracks such as "Zimbabwe",
            "Africa Unite", "Wake Up and Live", and "Survival" reflected
            Marley's support for the struggles of Africans. His appearance at
            the Amandla Festival in Boston in July 1979 showed his strong
            opposition to South African apartheid, which he already had shown in
            his song "War" in 1976. In early 1980, he was invited to perform at
            17 April celebration of Zimbabwe's Independence Day
          </li>
          <li>
            Marley received a state funeral in Jamaica on 21 May 1981, which
            combined elements of Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Rastafari tradition. He
            was buried in a chapel near his birthplace with his guitar
